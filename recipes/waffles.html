    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This waffle recipe is the only one you'll need to
        make homemade waffles with your waffle iron. Simple
        pantry ingredients mix up quickly in this easy batter
        that can be used right away or stored in the
        refrigerator for up to a week. Serve waffles hot with
        whipped cream and fresh fruit or with butter and maple
        syrup for either breakfast, brunch, or a snack.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs: This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.</li>
        <li>Milk: Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.</li>
        <li>Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.</li>
        <li>Sugar: A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
        <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step!</li>
        <li>Vanilla: A dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overfall flavor.</li>
        <li>Cooking spray: You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making the waffles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the batter: Whisk the eggs, then add the flour, milk, and oil. Whisk in the sugar. Stir in the remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Make the waffles: Pour the batter onto the hot, prepared waffle iron. Cook until golden brown and repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
